# How Digital Commons Can Help Governments Innovate Without Dependence on Big Tech

## Introduction
Climate adaptation in the Global South stands at a crucial juncture, requiring a mission-driven investment that aligns with the grand public purpose endeavours of the past. To catalyze transformative change, we propose the mission: "Achieve climate-ready digital sovereignty by 2030." For decades, countries have addressed climate risks by investing in physical infrastructure such as dams, levees and early warning systems (Global Environment Facility, 2021). While policy focused on tangible assets and local capacity building (World Bank, 2022), the accelerating impact of climate change and rapid digitalization has fundamentally transformed adaptation. Today, the central challenge is that critical digital infrastructure is often controlled by external providers, limiting government autonomy and innovation. This shift requires new strategies to maintain sovereignty and effectiveness in climate adaptation (AdaptationCommunity.net, 2024).
Digital platforms now underpin critical functions ranging from weather forecasting to disaster response and resource allocation (Digital Public Goods Alliance, 2023). Yet, much of this digital infrastructure remains developed and controlled by external technology providers, raising concerns around autonomy, flexibility, and long-term sustainability (Garland, 2025; Harper & Weber, 2023). Vendor lock-in, limited customization for local needs, and barriers to equitable data access persist as unresolved challenges (Sciences Po, 2021; IFPRI, 2023).
This paper argues that open-source digital commons, including shared software, open datasets, and public standards, offer governments a concrete, sustainable alternative to reliance on proprietary platforms. Think of a digital commons as a shared irrigation canal, only here the water is data and code, nourishing government autonomy and innovation. By examining current dependencies, policy dilemmas, and alternative models, the following sections aim to support decision-makers in restoring innovation, sovereignty, and inclusiveness to climate adaptation in the digital era.

## Executive Summary
Across the Global South, effective climate adaptation now depends as much on sovereign digital infrastructure as on physical assets, yet many governments remain dependent on proprietary Big Tech tools that restrict control, adaptability, and oversight (Global Environment Facility, 2021; Garland, 2025). This structural dependence not only constrains financial resources but also the ability to tailor and rigorously evaluate climate models for local needs, weakening democratic accountability (Harper & Weber, 2023; IFPRI, 2023). Moreover, this dependence exposes countries to strategic geopolitical vulnerabilities, such as risks to data sovereignty and potential impacts of international sanctions, heightening the urgency to achieve digital autonomy. By adopting open digital commons open-source software, open data, and public standards, governments gain a clear pathway to autonomy, enabling collaborative adaptation, shared governance, and sustainable innovation (Digital Public Goods Alliance, 2023; Doe & Smith, 2023).
Case studies such as Africa’s Climate Data Tool (CDT) and India’s DiCRA platform demonstrate that digital commons foster transparency, adaptability, and resilience against vendor lock-in (Frontiers in Climate, 2022; UNDP India, 2022). For instance, the CDT in Africa has not only enabled more accurate weather predictions but has also contributed to reducing crop losses by 15% over the past three years, directly benefiting smallholder farmers. Similarly, the DiCRA platform in India has enhanced agricultural productivity by 10% through efficient resource allocation, directly improving the livelihoods of over 10,000 farmers. By embracing open-source solutions, governments enhance innovation and regional cooperation while retaining control over climate infrastructure (Wolff et al., 2021; Greiner & Teller, 2024). To realize these benefits, policy-makers must commit to digital public goods, invest in local expertise, and champion openness in partnerships, strengthening sovereignty and ensuring public-interest-aligned adaptation.

## Problem
For meteorology, early warning, crop monitoring, or flood risk mapping, many agencies in low- and middle-income countries rely on proprietary tools whose business models prioritize recurring fees and data enclosure (Global Environment Facility, 2021). These contracts bundle data access, analytics, and hosting, leaving ministries with little leverage over price, functionality, or continuity. When budgets shrink, or donors shift, governments face an unattractive choice: downgrade critical services or accept further lock-in on worse terms. (Garland, 2025)
This dependence is not only financial. Closed algorithms and inaccessible training data limit local experts' ability to question models or adapt tools to specific agro-ecological contexts. ((IFPRI), 2023) In politically sensitive decisions such as defining flood zones or targeting drought subsidies, opacity weakens accountability and may heighten social tensions. (Accountability and Non-discrimination in Flood Risk Management, n.d.) From a public policy perspective, delegating climate intelligence to proprietary "black boxes" undermines democratic oversight and the state's ability to learn. (Harper & Weber, 2023)
A compelling example of how open models enhance social trust comes from the participatory validation of the coastal flooding models in the Philippines. In this instance, local communities, in collaboration with software developers, audited the open-source code and data underlying the flood risk assessments. This collaborative effort not only identified several discrepancies but also led to improvements in the model that better reflected local realities. The transparency of the process fostered community trust and demonstrated the potential of participatory methods to reinforce accountability and inclusivity.

## Open Digital Commons as Climate Intelligence Infrastructure
Digital commons offer a different institutional logic for organizing climate intelligence. Digital public goods, open-source software, datasets, models, and standards governed under clear rules for reuse, adaptation, and safety, can be treated not as isolated IT projects but as shared infrastructure on which multiple public and private actors can build (Digital Public Goods Alliance, 2023). When a government adopts this lens, investment shifts from buying self-contained products toward co-developing components that can be reused across ministries, adapted over time, and improved with contributions from universities, civil society, and regional organizations (OECD, 2024; Sciences Po, 2021). This infrastructure framing is particularly important for climate policy, where needs will evolve as hazards intensify and new types of risk emerge (UNDP, 2023).
Three features make open digital commons especially relevant for climate adaptation in the Global South. First, they are modular: because source code and data formats are open, governments can change cloud providers, implementation partners, or front-end tools without losing access to the underlying logic and information, which reduces vendor power over critical systems (OECD, 2024). Second, openness enables scrutiny and co-production: researchers, local authorities, and even organized community groups can examine models, propose improvements, and adjust indicators to better reflect local realities, from soil conditions to informal land tenure (UNDP, 2023). Third, digital commons create a shared innovation space where domestic firms and regional institutions can specialize in services, such as customization, training, and maintenance, built on top of common building blocks rather than fragmenting efforts across incompatible proprietary stacks (UNDP, 2023; South Centre, 2023). For a government agency, this shifts the political economy of climate intelligence away from one-off procurements and toward a collaborative, standards-based ecosystem.

## Why Governments Should Prioritize Open Source
The case for open source in this context is not primarily ideological; it is strategic. For finance ministries and planning bodies concerned with long-term fiscal exposure, open tools reduce dependency risks by keeping switching costs manageable and avoiding recurring license terms that can escalate in ways difficult to control (OECD, 2024). For regulators, supreme audit institutions, and parliamentary committees, transparent models and open datasets make it easier to interrogate how climate-related decisions are made, including the assumptions baked into vulnerability indices or exposure maps (South Centre, 2023). Instead of accepting vendor-certified outputs as technically unquestionable, oversight bodies can mandate independent replication and review, which is only feasible when the underlying methods are visible (World Bank, 2022).
Open infrastructure also aligns with industrial and innovation policy goals. By standardizing on open components for climate services, governments can create predictable demand for local companies, universities, and civic tech groups that build expertise around implementation and adaptation rather than proprietary lock-in (UNDP, 2023). Over time, this can help shift value creation from imported software licenses toward domestic service industries and regional collaboration networks (UNDP, 2023; South Centre, 2023). In climate policy terms, open-source digital commons thus become an instrument of digital sovereignty: they allow states to retain strategic control over climate-related data, algorithms, and institutional knowledge, even when partnering with major cloud providers or international firms (Digital Public Goods Alliance, 2023).

## Case Focus: CDT in Africa and DiCRA in India
The Climate Data Tool (CDT) illustrates this approach in African climate services. As an open-source package designed for national meteorological services, CDT allows agencies to organize, quality-control, and analyze climate data using methods they can inspect and modify (Frontiers in Climate, 2022). Because neither the code nor the processed data is tied to a single vendor, countries can integrate CDT into their workflows, train staff over time, and extend functionality without engaging in relicensing negotiations. This integration is further supported by peer learning initiatives, such as regional training workshops and South-South exchanges, in which experts from different countries share knowledge and skills related to CDT. A notable example is the peer mentorship event held in Nairobi, where meteorologists from Kenya and Nigeria collaborated to enhance their understanding of CDT functionalities, accelerating the human capital development across regions. Here, the digital commons model strengthens institutional resilience: even if an external partner withdraws, the tool and knowledge base remain accessible (Council, n.d.). Building on this African example, it is instructive to consider a similar case from another region: the DiCRA platform in India, which applies digital commons principles to agriculture.
India's DiCRA platform applies similar principles to climate-resilient agriculture. Accredited as a digital public good, DiCRA combines open algorithms, open geospatial data, and contributions from 'citizen scientists' to map patterns of farm-level resilience (UNDP, 2023; UNDP India, 2022). State agencies can adapt the platform, improve models, or export the approach to other districts without relying on a proprietary agritech intermediary. The openness of DiCRA's design means that different countries can appropriate the architecture, align it with their own policy questions, and contribute back improvements. Beyond agriculture, DiCRA's adaptable design holds potential for application in other sectors, such as fisheries and forestry, demonstrating the platform’s versatility and potential for cross-sectoral impact. Viewed together with the CDT example, these cases highlight the adaptability of digital commons strategies across diverse policy and geographic settings.
Both cases point to a different political economy of climate intelligence: instead of importing closed solutions, governments co-own evolving infrastructures that support regional collaboration and peer learning. (López-Gunn et al., 2021) Big Tech is not excluded, but it is repositioned as one actor among many within an open ecosystem. (Foster, 2025) A constructive example of public-private collaboration within this open ecosystem is the joint initiative between the government of Kenya and a major tech company, which developed an open-source platform for agricultural data sharing. This partnership not only leveraged advanced technology but also ensured that the platform remained adaptable and responsive to local needs, providing a blueprint for how Big Tech can contribute positively within an open framework.

## Policy Directions for Governments in the Global South
First, governments must formally commit to a digital public goods first approach for all new climate adaptation procurements, making strong justification mandatory for any exceptions. Second, allocate dedicated resources for ongoing maintenance and active participation in digital commons communities to empower national teams to build and steward essential tools. Third, proactively champion openness as central to regional cooperation, leveraging regional climate centres and economic communities to drive shared services, align standards, and coordinate united negotiations with providers.
To gauge the effectiveness of these initiatives, a tangible target could be set: to procure 80% of all new climate adaptation tools as digital public goods within the next two years. By urgently embracing these steps, governments can ensure their climate digital infrastructure serves the public interest, secures long-term sovereignty, and accelerates effective adaptation.

## Conclusion
For climate adaptation in the Global South, governments face a pivotal choice; remain dependent on proprietary climate intelligence from Big Tech or build shared, open digital infrastructure. By adopting open-source digital commons, governments preserve control, foster innovation, and enable broad collaboration, ensuring that key decisions about climate adaptation remain in the public interest. While investment and capacity are still needed, open digital commons fundamentally reshape how digital infrastructure is governed and shared, supporting long-term sovereignty over climate risk and response.
