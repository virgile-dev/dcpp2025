# How is the spread of AI challenging the shared governance of digital commons?

## Introduction
Digital commons play a central role in creating and sustaining the digital infrastructure of society. However, the rise of AI has several important consequences for the functions of digital commons. AI-models are largely trained on high-quality data collected from digital commons, while they themselves often create hight quantities of low-quality data, making it difficult to keep up with human quality assurance (Huang & Siddarth). This begs the question: should the governance of digital commons effectively be substituted for automatic algorithms instead of human collective decision-making? This short policy brief argues that it is important to keep human-driven governance as a central driving factor for continued governance of digital commons. 

## Definition of digital commons
Digital commons can be defined as digital systems or solutions, that are maintained by communities through peer collaboration (Open Future). What characterizes digital commons are that they are a shared ressource, they have a shared governance, and that the commoning has a potential for society and state (Peugeot). The concept of shared governance has been hightligted as a main driving factor and advantage of digital commons (Hess & Ostrom 2007). But with the increasing spread of AI, it is relevant to ask, whether shared human governance of digital commons might effectively be replaced with AI-governance. In other words, can peer collaboration between individuals be replaced by automatization and algorithms. 

## Arguments for 
The main arguments for AI-driven governance is that digital commons operate in increasingly complex systems and in such scales, that they exceed human capacities (manyika et al.). Automation therefore has the potential to increase efficiency, consistency and scalability of existing common networks (Ibid). Likewise, AI might be able to adress existing human bias and discrimination problems more efficienctly (Crawford)

## Arguments against
Argue against AI-driven governance stress that the efficiency-centered view risks reducing governance to optimization, overlooking the political and deliberative functions that commons governance historically performs. While algorithms make the governance process optimized and predictable, these only contain and display facts about the world. It is precisely these facts that need to be made meaningful and important by humans (Rouvroy). 
Secondly, complicated algorithm decision-making creates uncertainty about the accountability of governance and decision-making. (Pasquale). Systems may be created by individuals or small-groups, with little common knowledge of which filters and parameters are used for decision-making (Huang & Siddarth). In other words, it is unclear *how* decisions are made and *who* is responsible for them (Pasquale, 2015). This idea of a "black box" puts emphasis on the importance of human participation and perspectives in governing in general and of digital commons. Disagreements that arise from governing and deliberative interactions should not be seen as a sign of ineffectiveness, but rather as an important feature or the decision-making process.

The thought of AI-governance as a black box also point towards the problem of ownership.

This is further problematized by the ownership of AI of big tech companies, which results in vulnerabilities to hidden agendas and creates unstable geopolitical issues (Rouvroy). 

While Crawford argued that AI-driven governance might help reduce human-existing bias, Eubanks highlight how data-driven policy and governance might do the exact oppositve, by reinforcing the burdens of already marginalized groups (Eubanks, 2018). This is harmful due to the fact, that commons according to Ostrom benefit from the "wisdom of crowds" principe, where problems are best solved through collective deliberation and participation from individuals with different skillsets (Leyronas, Coriat & Nubukpo). 



This further challenges the value of efficiency, if it has devastating consequences for democratic participation for vulnerable groups.

What the abovementioned hightlights is that AI, in governance as well as in general, has immense potentiale to increase productivity and efficiency of a wide-array of sectors. But, the counterargument also show, that it should be implemented cautiously.

## So how should this be done?
Despite the concerns about AI-governance, it should in no way be disregarded as a powerful and effective tool. AI can significantly improve effectiveness of governance and decision-making, but should not replace the human elements (OECD). It should help to enlighten and empower already existing systems, making sure to include the human perspectives in automated processes. 
The importance of the legal framework cannot be overstated, and nation-states should work towards sustaining secure, transparent, fair and sustainable AI (OECD).
