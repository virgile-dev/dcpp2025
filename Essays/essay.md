# How is the spread of AI challenging the shared governance of digital commons?

## Introduction
Digital commons play a central role in creating and sustaining the digital infrastructure of digital commons. However, the rise of AI may lead to questions of whether the governance of digital commons could effectively be substituted for automatic algorithms instead of human participation. This short policy brief argues that it is important to keep human-driven governance as a central driving factor for continued governance of digital commons. 

## Definition of digital commons
Digital commons can be defined as digital systems or solutions, that are maintained by communities through peer collaboration (Open Future). What characterizes digital commons are that they are a shared ressource, they have a shared governance, and that the commoning has a potential for soeciety and state (Peugeot). But, with the rise of AI, a growing concern has been raised, that the shared governance of digital commons might be replaced with AI-governance - that is, the peer collaboration between individuals might be replaced by automatization and algorithms. The focus of this essay will therefore be on the concept of shared governance, which has been hightlighted as a main driving factor (and advantage) of digital commons, (Hess & Ostrom 2007), but also as one of the main concerts of where AI might replace human skills and qualities. 

## Arguments for 
The main arguments for AI-driven governance is that digital commons operate in increasingly complex systems and in such scales, that they exceed human capacities (manyika et al.). Automation might thereby increase efficiency, consistency and scalability of existing common networks (Ibid). Likewise, AI might be able to adress existing human bias and discrimination problems more efficienctly (Crawford)

## Arguments against
However, this efficiency-centered view risks reducing governance to optimization, overlooking the political and deliberative functions that commons governance historically performs. Whil algorithms make the governance process optimized and predictable, these only contain and display facts about the world - facts that need to be made meaningful and important by humans (Rouvroy). This is further problematized by the ownership of AI of big tech companies, which results in vulnerabilities to hidden agendas and creates unstable geopolitical issues (Rouvroy). 
Secondly, complicated algorithm decision-making creates uncertainty about on what grounds decisions are made, thus raising questions about accountability of governance (Pasquale). Governance by humans is exactly preffered, since disagreements in the governance has to be solved through deliberative interactions. Effectivenes is this not the only important goals to achieve, since they should also stand on grounds of consensus and political agreement. The "ineffectiveness" should be seen as a feature, and not a problem. 

While Crawford argued that AI-driven governance might help reduce human-existing bias, Eubanks highlight how data-driven policy and governance might do the exact oppositve, by reinforcing the burdens of already marginalized groups (Eubanks, 2018). This further challenges the value of efficiency, if it has devastating consequences for democratic participation for vulnerable groups. 

What the abovementioned hightlights is that AI, in governance as well as in general, has immense potentiale to increase productivity and efficiency of a wide-array of sectors. But, the counterargument also show, that it should be implemented cautiously.

## So how should this be done?
AI should work as a tool and improve effectiveness - but should not replace human decision-making (OECD). I should help to enlighten and empower already existing systems, making sure to include the human perspectives in otherwise automated processes.
